This script is provided under the BSD license.

You will need pyinotify to make this work. Once installed, you just 
need to specify what directory you want to watch. For now it takes 
two arguments: 

[1] mode you want to run the script as:
1 - monitors OPENED files
2 - monitors ACCESSED files
3 - monitors CREATED files

[2] directory you wish to monitor (lose the trailing / in the end of
the path)

Make sure you edit the script to set your mail address and smtp host.

Then you can run it like: ./snitch.py 2 /tmp

Any question please send a mail
